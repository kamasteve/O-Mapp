Notes on the Communication Engineer Assigmnment

B.  Proposed System 
In the proposed system, the post paid energy meters are replaced by digital energy meters having communication option. 
By using modbus communication  of the digital energy  meters,  all meters 
can be monitored online on centralized SCADA. As the 
meter   reading   is   recorded    automatically    by   the 
SCADA. So, there is no chance of human errors.  
The   whole   proposed   system   is   prepaid   and   the 
consumer has to pay before using the electricity. 
C.   Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) System
Automatic meter reading system is a technology which 
is  used  to  gather  data  from  energy  metering  devices
and transfer  it to  a central station in order to  process it 
for  billing  purposes.  Automatic  meter  reading  system 
helps  the  customer  and  energy  provider  to  access  the 
accurate   and  updated   data   from   the   meters.  AMR 
system   can   fetch   energy   consumption   in   hourly, 
monthly,  yearly  basis on request or even in Real Time. 
This Real time energy usage can be seen by the users to 
control the use of power and be more economical. With 
the  help  of  the  collected  data  the  service  provider
  will 
be able to send energy saving ideas to the users.
